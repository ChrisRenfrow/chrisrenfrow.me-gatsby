## 3rd time's the charm

Hello and welcome to my small corner of the internet where I will document my latest adventures in tech and life. Who knows, maybe you or someone else will get something out of what I have to say. But make no mistake, I'm doing this entirely for my own benefit.

> "3rd? If you've started a blog so many times, where are all of your old posts? Why start from scratch again?"

Great question. Well, in all honesty I never backed my old posts up properly and frankly, it wasn't worth it as most of them pertained to the development of my old website. Next question.

> "Who are you?" 

I'm a full-stack software developer that just enjoys working on products that genuinely aim to be beneficial without jeopardizing the end-user's privacy. I'm also a self-proclaimed tinkerer, hacker, and maker. At the time of writing I'm working remotely from somewhere in sunny California for a couple of awesome clients. I am joined by my wonderful girlfriend, a fun-sized doggo, and one mildly spooky cat.

That's all the questions I'll be taking today, this post is for all intents and purposes a placeholder for the actual content. See you around.
