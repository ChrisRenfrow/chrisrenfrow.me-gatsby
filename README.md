This is a complete rebuild of my old site which was basically just a Ghost blogging server with some UI tweaks. Built from the ground-up using React and hosting via Heroku. I'm checking out CircleCI and CodeClimate because I need to get used to this kind of develop/deploy life-cycle.

Thanks for dropping by.
