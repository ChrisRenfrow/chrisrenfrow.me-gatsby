## Who is Chris Renfrow?
Hi there! I'm a full-stack web-dev from sunny California with a soft-spot for projects that involve block-chain or machine-learning. I've been working professionally for almost a year now with plenty of experience beyond that 'off-record' working for friends, family and acquaintances. 

I like pretending I have good taste in beer and doing crazy things like stay in a van for a month while I figure out how anybody can afford to live in the Bay Area.
