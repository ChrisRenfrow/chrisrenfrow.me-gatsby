## New and Improved
This blog is back and better than ever! Instead of using Ghost blogging platform I've decided to make this blog truly my own. Developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (hella cool static site generator for React) I can now more effectively make changes to my website as I improve my web-dev skills. At the time of writing, this site is strongly derived from the lovely [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) from which I plan on adding the features I had through Ghost (commenting) and all the things I've been wanting to add since!

## More to Come
Currently I'm just making some final changes to the code before I publish it for everyone to see. After that I'll write a much over-due update on what I've been up to for the last year or so since my last update (which you will probably have already read)! I'm also toying with the idea of importing my old posts to this platform... At any rate, see you around!
